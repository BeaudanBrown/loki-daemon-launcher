# how to run

We're assuming you already have the lokid and lokinet binaries somewhere...

edit index.js check over the config variables at the top

`node index.js`

This will provide an interactive console with lokid with lokinet running in the background
`exit` will quit both.


# install nodejs

Ubuntu node installation:

`curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo bash -`

then

`sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`
